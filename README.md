# Longest-Common-Prefix

Longest Common Prefix
    Example 1:
    Let the set of strings to be {"flower", "fly", "flow"}
    The longest common prefix is "fl"

    Example 2:
    Let the set of strings to be {"dog", "donkey", "door", "cat"}
    The longest common prefix is "", i.e., empty string. 
    Since there is no common prefix at all.
